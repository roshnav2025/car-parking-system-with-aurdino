ABSTRACT-
We have brought to your notice our concept of an simulator for car parking ,where we use concepts we have learned from M.P.C.A  to construct a mini model of the above stated where we construct a 6 slots parking working on the basis on sensors which detect movement (motion detector sensor-IR sensors) to detect whether a car is allocated to the respective parking compartment for the secondary car to relatively park in whatever compartment is available relatively in a sequential order, also two sensors are used to detect whether the car is entering or vacating the parking compartment based on which sensor detects motion first

COMPONENTS REQUIRED-
Arduino Uno
 20Ã—4 LCD Display
 I2C LCD Module
 Male Header
 Female Header
 IR Sensor x 8
Mini Servo Motor SG-90 
Female DC Power Jack
 5v 2Amp Power Adapter
